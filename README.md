# android_programming_dice
This app shows a random image of number one to six.
Just like when we roll the dice, random number would show up on the screen.
This app could be used in cases like choosing a number randomly.
Additionally, there shows statistical data of how often the number showed up.
This might help to check whether this app is really random.(If this is the case, the sum of each number should be similar.)
I used java math.ran() method.
